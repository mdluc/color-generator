## Idea
I've learned about the javascript library called "values.js" while studying react from a tutorial but decided to add my own touch to this project so I've decided to use technologies like react-bootstrap for some of my components, and changed some of the logic behind the initial project from the tuts.

## How does it work?
The main idea of this project is that it takes two values: a color and a number (gradation) so it can generate a variety of tints and shades. How do we do that? Using the javascript library called "values.js" which, basically, adds a percentage of white/black to the given color so it turns into a tint/shade. The gradation's value is a number between 1-100, and if the input is either a blank space or a value out of range, an error will occur.
